This website includes some of my personal information such as my personal interests, hobbies, academic formation and projects. The design is responsive for small, medium and large devices according to bootstrap sizing. To start, there's a navigation bar including a personal logo for user recall, two play/pause buttons that play a song and some links that help access the website sections easily. Then, there's a banner including my name and a picture, which can be replaced with a personal photo. After this, there are four sections with my description, skills as a chart, hobbies with scrollable cards, academic timeline with a description for each period, and projects. Finally, there's a footer with a button linked to a text file with all the references of the external elements used throughout the website, and other three buttons that link personal resources for contact.
